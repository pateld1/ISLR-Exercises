# ISLR-Exercises

To view each set of exercises, open the .html file. If the file is too large, download it and view it in your favorite web browser. Alternatively, open the corresponding .pdf file. This file will usually be cumbersome to read due to the size of the document. 

As an added bonus, a book outline is also shared here which I wrote up in LaTeX.
